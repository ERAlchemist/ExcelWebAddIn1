The following is a precursor for the SOP regarding the generation and naming of ARs...

**Scenario A:**  (A.K.A The Happy Path)
    A sample comes in the lab for a panel #26.  The sample is analyzed and data added to `daily misc sheet`.  In addition, an AR form is generated using [AR-form.xlsm](URL-to-form). The data will be added to the pre-polish tab of the sheet.  
    
    File-Names:**
        The AR-form will be saved using the following naming scheme:<br><br>

            `BaseLotID-Tank_ID.xlsm`

        #{sample_label_image}

        For example
           ` Example: 
                Vintage: "2016",
                Brand: "Meiomi",
                Type: "Chardonnay",
                BaseLotID: "CH16MEIOMI01A",
                FullLotID: "CH16MEIOMI01A...........,"  #insert actual example lot number#
                Tank_ID: "2036"`<br><br>
            
            would have the following file name<br>
                `CH16MEIOMI01A-2036.xlsm'
